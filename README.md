# ft_printf

The `ft_printf` project at 42 school is a fundamental exercise designed to teach students how to implement their own version of the standard C function `printf`. This project is part of the curriculum at 42, a network of nonprofit, tuition-free computer programming schools.

Here are some key aspects of the `ft_printf` project:

1. **Objective**: The main goal is to implement a function named `ft_printf` that mimics the behavior of the standard `printf` function from `<stdio.h>`. This includes handling format specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, `%f`, and others, as well as flags, width, precision, and length modifiers.

2. **Learning Outcomes**: Students learn about string parsing, handling variable arguments using `<stdarg.h>`, managing memory allocation, and ensuring correct output formatting. It's a practical exercise in understanding the intricacies of C functions, memory management, and string manipulation.

3. **Challenges**: Implementing `ft_printf` involves dealing with various edge cases, such as different combinations of format specifiers, handling special characters, managing memory dynamically, and ensuring the function behaves correctly according to the C standard.

4. **Project Structure**: Students are expected to create their implementation from scratch, adhering to specific rules and guidelines provided by the school. This includes norm compliance (42's coding style guide), which emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and efficiency.

## Usage

To use the `ft_printf` function:

Include the `ft_printf.h` header file in your C program. Call `ft_printf` in your code with the desired format string and arguments, just like you would with the standard printf function.
